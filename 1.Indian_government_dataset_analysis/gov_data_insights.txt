Initial Analysis of the Dataset

##Dataset Overview:
* The dataset contains 3,312 rows and 11 columns.
* It records the pollution levels across various states and cities in India.
* The dataset has 196 missing values.
* The data types include text (categorical) and numerical values.

##Key Analysis:
*The dataset contains pollution data from various cities and monitoring stations across India.
*Some states and cities have higher concentrations of specific pollutants than others.
*The dataset includes pollutants like PM10, NO2, CO, OZONE, and NH3.
*PM10 and NO2 are among the most frequently recorded pollutants.
*Pollution levels vary by state and city, possibly due to industrial activity, vehicle emissions, and population density.

## Dataset Observations:

1. Date Range & Missing Data:
   - The dataset has 196 missing values
   - The missing values are replaced with median for better efficiency

2. High Pollution in Major Cities:
     - Cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata have consistently high pollution levels due to heavy traffic and industrial activities.

3. Dominant Pollutants:
          - PM10 and NO2 are the most common pollutants, indicating that vehicle emissions and construction activities are major contributors to pollution.
           - Some cities show higher levels of NH3, likely due to agricultural activities and waste processing.
4. Statistical Insights:
       - The T-test confirmed that PM10 and NO2 levels are significantly different, meaning they may come from different sources.
        - The Chi-Square Test showed no significant relationship between the type of pollutant and the city, meaning pollution sources are common across multiple cities.

5. Pollution Spikes in Urban Areas:
       - Metropolitan areas experience frequent pollution spikes, while smaller cities show more stable pollution levels.
